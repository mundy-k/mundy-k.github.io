I just use two entire cans of fat-free condensed milk and keep the other ingredients at the specified amount (this often means I have enough for two 9-in pie crusts or one 12-in with some raw batter left to eat).\nGoes well with homemade whipped cream.\n\nLemon Curd Thumbprint Cookies\n\nCan substitute the lemon curd for your preferred jam or fruit preserve (I’m a big fan of raspberry).\nI always use 2-3 times more cinnamon to give the cookie a little more flavor.\nMake sure you have enough space to store these! Even after they fully cool, the curd tends to be sticky, so they’re not very stackable.\n\nSugar Cookies (Cutout)\n\nIf there aren’t allergy concerns, I recommend adding a bit of almond extract.\nI always chill the dough for at least 20-30 minutes (but that’s also because I’m usually ready for a break after mixing the dough by hand).\nUse powdered sugar instead of flour when you’re rolling them out!\nGood base cookie for royal icing."
