    "text": "First-Year PhD student at the Columbia Social Neuroscience Lab with Dr. Meghan Meyer.\n\nHi! My name is Kaitlyn and I’m interested in what we mean when we say we know someone.\nSocial interactions are dynamic, information-dense, and often ambiguous, and yet we still rapidly extract and interpret relevant information about other people and build up predictions and/or assumptions of what they are like more generally. We’re capable of making these inferences both as participants in our own social networks and as observers of third-party social networks. My current primary lines of interests revolve around:\n\nLoneliness, social connection, and shared reality\nInterpretation and prediction of self and others\nIndividual differences in recall and/or reinterpretation of social information\n\n\nLast updated: 11/11/2025 (This website is very much in the process of being built, please bear with me :))"

I just use two entire cans of fat-free condensed milk and keep the other ingredients at the specified amount (this often means I have enough for two 9-in pie crusts or one 12-in with some raw batter left to eat).\nGoes well with homemade whipped cream.\n\nLemon Curd Thumbprint Cookies\n\nCan substitute the lemon curd for your preferred jam or fruit preserve (I’m a big fan of raspberry).\nI always use 2-3 times more cinnamon to give the cookie a little more flavor.\nMake sure you have enough space to store these! Even after they fully cool, the curd tends to be sticky, so they’re not very stackable.\n\nSugar Cookies (Cutout)\n\nIf there aren’t allergy concerns, I recommend adding a bit of almond extract.\nI always chill the dough for at least 20-30 minutes (but that’s also because I’m usually ready for a break after mixing the dough by hand).\nUse powdered sugar instead of flour when you’re rolling them out!\nGood base cookie for royal icing."
