Hi! My name is Kaitlyn and I'm interested in what we mean when we say we know someone.

Social interactions are dynamic, information-dense, and often ambiguous, and yet we still rapidly extract and interpret relevant information about other people and build up predictions and/or assumptions of what they are like more generally. We're capable of making these inferences both as participants in our own social networks and as observers of third-party social networks. My current primary lines of interests revolve around:

1. Loneliness, social connection, and shared reality
2. Interpretation and prediction of self and others
3. Individual differences in recall and/or reinterpretation of social information
