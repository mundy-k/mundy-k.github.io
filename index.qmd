Hi! My name is Kaitlyn and I'm interested in what we mean when we say we know someone.

Social interactions are dynamic, information-dense, and often ambiguous, and yet we rapidly extract and interpret relevant information about other people and build up ideas of who they are and predictions/assumptions of how they might behave in other contexts. My current primary lines of interests revolve around:

1. Social connection and shared reality
2. Interpretation and prediction of others
3. Individual differences in recall and/or reinterpretation of social information
